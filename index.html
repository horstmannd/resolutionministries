    “God used the Prayer Resolution process to break off lies and bring freedom that I did not even realize was lacking. As a pastor, I dream and pray for the day when all of our pastoral staff and lay leaders will have access to PR and have the courage to go through the process.”<br>

    “The Lord broke many of the chains, which I also carried…even in my relationships with others, I can sense more of God’s freedom and ability
    to move through me…Of course, there are still struggles and battles in life but I guess I feel better equipped.”<br>

    “I have gained enormous freedom in learning through PR. As a pastor's wife, I have gained confidence and assertiveness in putting my efforts where they are most needed in the church. I am now ministering to women and doing PR sessions with several ladies.  One woman's husband remarked to me that for the first time in 50 years his wife is happy and at peace in the Lord, and her suicidal desires are gone!  Praise God!  Prayer Resolution works!”<br>
