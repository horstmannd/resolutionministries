# about

About:
Raised on the mission field of Ethiopia by loving Christian parents, Marcia gave her heart to the Lord as a little girl, and soon made Jesus Christ the center of her affection and life direction. However, it was years later, through a very dark time of brokenness and pain, that God met her in a new way, to bring her healing and a whole new level of dependence on Him and on His bride, the Church.  Soon after that experience she felt God’s call on her life into focused ministry.  After attending Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, MN, receiving a Master of Divinity degree, and subsequent Prayer Resolution training, she was involved in Prayer Resolution as a facilitator and went on staff at a church plant in Hudson, WI. In 2015 the Lord called her to Marshall, MN, where she lives with her husband, David Horstmann.

Marcia is licensed by the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference as a licensed minister, and is an enthusiastic supporter of the CCCC! She has a passion for those in ministry who have intentionally
chosen the path of spiritual brokenness and desire to be used by God to bring healing and wholeness to others. She loves God’s word and any opportunity to teach it, preach it, read it, and pray from it!

# Ministries

Resolution Ministries: Individual Sessions-
Prayer Resolution is a process of directed specific prayer, to resolve the issues that hinder us from a closer walk with God, meaningful relationships and effective ministry.

Prayer Resolution uses biblical instruction, intercession, support, and a proven process to help individuals gain God’s perspective of our lives, relationships, patterns and assumptions, bringing healing and freedom. It is completely dependent on God’s intervention and power to break the on-going force of our sin and the sin of others, clearing the way for God to begin his deeper work in our lives to live out our fullest potential in all that he created us to be and do.
