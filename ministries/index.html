      Prayer Resolution is a process of directed specific prayer, to resolve the issues that hinder us from a closer walk with God, meaningful relationships and effective ministry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Prayer Resolution uses biblical instruction, intercession, support, and a proven process to help individuals gain God’s perspective of our lives, relationships, patterns and assumptions, bringing healing and freedom. It is completely dependent on God’s intervention and power to break the on-going force of our sin and the sin of others, clearing the way for God to begin his deeper work in our lives to live out our fullest potential in all that he created us to be and do.
