        <span>Marcia Horstmann<br>Founder of Resolution Ministries</span>
      </div>
      <p>
        Raised on the mission field of Ethiopia by loving Christian parents, Marcia gave her heart to the Lord as a little girl, and soon made Jesus Christ the center of her affection and life direction.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it was years later, through a very dark time of brokenness and pain, that God met her in a new way, to bring her healing and a whole new level of dependence on Him and on His bride, the Church.  Soon after that experience she felt God’s call on her life into focused ministry.  After attending Bethel Seminary in St. Paul, MN, receiving a Master of Divinity degree, and subsequent Prayer Resolution training, she was involved in Prayer Resolution as a facilitator and went on staff at a church plant in Hudson, WI. In 2015 the Lord called her to Marshall, MN, where she lives with her husband, David Horstmann.
